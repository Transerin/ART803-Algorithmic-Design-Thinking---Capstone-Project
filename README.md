# ART803 Algorithmic Design Thinking - Capstone Project
This is a coursework for 2022-2023 ART803 Algorithmic Design Thinking at Cardiff University.

**Unfortunately, the Topological 3D viewer is currently unavailable in the Streamlit cloud version due to limitations in parsing BREP files. As a result, you will find a blank window in the cloud deployment. However, if you would like to experience the Topological 3D viewer, you can clone this repository to your local machine and follow the instructions provided below to explore the viewer locally.**

You can access the cloud-based Streamlit application [here](https://frankart803project.streamlit.app/).

## To run the app locally
Python >= 3.9
- Clone the repo locally, go into the directory and run the following commands

- `pip install -r requierments.txt`

- `streamlit run Horsens_Weather_Data.py`
